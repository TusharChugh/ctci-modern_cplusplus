/**
 * @brief Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than
 * or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the
 * adjacent integers.
 * For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {S, 2} are valleys. Given
 * an array
 * of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: {S, 3, 1,2, 3}
 * Output: {S, 1,3,2, 3}
